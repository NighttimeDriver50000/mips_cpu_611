# Bog-Standard Classwork MIPS CPU

I wrote this MIPS CPU as part of CSCE 611 at USC in 2016. We wrote it for the
Altera tools, but I'd like to get it to work with Verilator.

Currently, however, it's just a dump of the files from that class.

The code is MIT licensed, but there are *far* better MIPS CPUs out there.
